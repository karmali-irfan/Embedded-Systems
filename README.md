# Embedded-Systems

The microcontrolled used for these labs is the ATmega328. The datasheet can be found online with ease. 
I have uploaded all the assignments from our Embedded Systems Lab. The first few labs cover the basics of working with a microcontroller and coding in Embedded C. However, the FinalTasks wholly encompass all concepts covered and taught throughout the lab course.
